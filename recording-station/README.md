# Zero-knowledge Audiovisual Club Recording Station 

Helping communities document themselves to build an open, living archive for and by the people involved. 

## TL;DR 

The Zk Av Club Recording Station is an on-site media lab that lets event-goers record conversations and insights with high-quality audio/video, contributing to a growing community-made archive. 

## What this is

We flip the script on event coverage: instead of top-down coverage, our Recording Station empowers in-person event attendees‚Äîbuilders, organizers, artists, researchers, and communities‚Äîto tell their stories on their own terms. 

From impromptu podcasts and deep-dive conversations to quick reflections and group discussions, we provide the tools and space to create authentic, high-quality content and preserve community memory. 

After recordings are approved by guests, the edit goes out on Zk Av Club and/or co-creator channels, and the source recordings are published to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA. Open media, shared memory. 


## Why we do it

* **Self-representation:** People choose to speak for themselves, not through a selection filter. 

* **Connection:** A fun space to meet, collaborate, and riff. 

* **Memory:** Insightful conversations become community memory‚Äînot lost in the hallway. 


## What‚Äôs on the table

üé• **Pro tools** 

HD cams, lights, handheld & lav mics, portable mixer/recorder, and field kits for hallway interviews. 

üë• **On-site help** 

Crew supports setup, recording, and (if you want) hosting. Low-pressure, inclusive vibe. 

üïì **Flexible sessions** 

Walk in or book ahead‚Äîsolo, pairs, roundtables, or live panels. 


## Formats to spark inspiration

## Distribution & Licensing 

* **Edited release first:** After guest approvals, edited videos are published on Zk Av Club and/or co-creator channels. 

* **Then open the source:** Following the edited release, original source masters (audio/video) are publicly released to Internet Archive under Creative Commons CC BY-SA. 

* **Consent & credits:** Clear approvals, attribution, and metadata at every step. (If sensitive content requires alternatives, we can agree on it in advance.)
