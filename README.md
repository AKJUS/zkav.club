## Zero-knowledge Audiovisual Club 

We are a collective of experts and students exploring audiovisual art and creativity in the context of decentralized and open source technology while supporting events in our communities, both on-location and online. 

Our mission is to share and preserve the valuable information presented and discussed at conferences, meetups and camps ‚Äî aiming to provide access to this previously exclusive knowledge to the entire world. 

In addition to livestreaming and recording, we invite curious individuals to learn alongside us, sharing our production skills and insights with those interested in amplifying their own communities.

### Testimonials 

> Zk Av Club is a throwback to the grass roots ethos of the early days of the crypto revolution. Uncompromising in their community-first approach to audio/visual education and support, Zk Av Club gives a voice to the individuals behind the camera, in the booth, working before, during and after the event to share the news and progress the world needs to know. The Zcash Foundation was an early champion for the Club and we remain invested in their present and their bright future. The world needs more impactful and community-led projects like the Zk Av Club!

> I've always been fascinated with how folks find things because it illustrates a unique mapping. On its face, this might seem insignificant , but if you study these mappings on a deeper level, you realize something special; a shielded truth. On my journey discovering Zcash, I randomly discovered AdjyLeak, and in conjunction, the zkav.club. Through the club, I experienced not only my first time connecting with *many* like minded folks through live streaming, but also a vast archive of knowledge I didn't even knew existed! If you like adventure, computer science, and community, I couldn't recommend a better environment to start your journey.

> Ryan and Zk Av Club are great, not just a streaming and media team but also deep community leadership and advocacy. They have been a reliable fixture of the Zcash community as well as adjacent ones like dweb, and has helped make connections with other local communities around the globe like Zcash Brazil. They've run self contained livestream and recording for Zcash conferences, as well as hosting chill hybrid and remote hangouts. My favorite is seeing Ryan bring AV training sessions to newly formed local groups with minimal equipment, empowering them to improve their own global media abilities and stay included.

Its Event Calendar is filled with a variety of in-person and virtual meetups ranging from Crypto and Hacker Conferences to Music Production and Brand Design, there's something for everyone to have fun with. Zk Av also provides video and audio editing support, some of the best AI image generation prompts you will ever come across, hands on workshops with new, obscure P2P software - all just a glimpse into what happens over at the club!

> The ZK Audiovisual Club is a source of inspiration for me and for everyone who comes. Seeing the work they do behind the scenes and then the staging in each event or streaming, is definitely a motivation to learn more about everything audiovisual. As a member of the team I can say that every day is an opportunity to learn, grow and contribute from my knowledge as well. Long live the club!
