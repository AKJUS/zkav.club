**Have you learned something exciting from Zero-knowledge Audiovisual Club (Zk Av Club) Foundry?**  

Do you have new skills, tools, or innovative ideas that you're eager to explore with your communities?  

We're looking for everyone who wants to share what we've learned together and what you're doing with that newfound knowledge. This is your chance to lead an interactive workshop, empower others, and be rewarded with **200 EUR** paid in Zcash.

- **Community Impact**: Share your audiovisual skills and knowledge, empowering others with new creative and technical abilities. 

- **Visibility and Recognition**: Host an exploration of new ideas with a community committed to cooperation and innovation. 

- **Personal Growth**: Enhance your presentation and teaching skills in a collaborative and friendly environment—*your own community!* 

- **Direct Reward**: Receive **200 EUR** paid in Zcash for your time and dedication.

## How can you participate?

Community-led Zk Av Club Foundry Workshops must be livestreamed to an interactive chat platform where your active community gathers (like Discord, Telegram, etc.) so you can take live questions and feedback. 

Workshops must also be recorded or, better yet, also streamed to a platform that records, like YouTube.

### Key points to structure your workshop proposal:

1. **Topic and Content** 

   - Your workshop must center on audiovisual techniques and tools that have been covered in Zk Av Club Foundry sessions and workshops. We encourage you to build upon these foundations and share your unique insights and practical applications. 
   
   - **Workshop Topics** (More coming soon!): 
   
     - Restreaming a virtual conference or meetup 
     - Live transcription and translation 
     - Community-led workshop production 
     - Basic video editing for social media (clips) 
     - Internet Archive Command-line Interface (CLI) 
     - Recording station development and deployments 
     - Introduction to livestream production 
     - Audio production and/or post-production 
     - Equipment for audio production – various budgets 

2. **Instructional Design: Make it clear, useful, and accessible!** 

   - **What will participants learn?** Define one or two clear objectives by the end of the workshop. 
   
   - **How will you structure it?** For example: a brief introduction, practical demonstrations, a simple exercise, a Q&A session. 
   
   - **What methods will you use?** Visual presentations, live software demos, project examples, open discussions? 
   
   - **Will you need supporting materials?** Useful links, resources, example files, a short tutorial?

3. **Proposed Date and Duration** 

   - Please indicate your preferred date to livestream your workshop.

4. **Required Resources** 

   - Detail any specific tools, software, or resources that you or participants might need for the workshop. For example:
     - An internet connect.
     - Video/audio editing software.
     - Access to P2P or decentralized platforms. 
     - Basic hardware requirements (if applicable, such as a good internet connection for streaming).

5. **Language** 

   - Your workshop can be delivered in any language. Please specify the language in your proposal.

6. **Need for Simultaneous Translation** 

   - Your workshop may be restreamed with simultaneous translation to Zk Av Club channels for a wider audience. This means that we can handle the translation and streaming to our channels, so just be aware of this added reach and coordinate with the Zk Av Club Foundry team if you want this support! 

7. **Availability for Test Connection** 

   - It's important that we conduct a test rehearsal with you before the workshop. This ensures everything is being done correctly and works perfectly (audio, video, screen sharing, etc.). Please confirm your availability for this rehearsal.

8. **Required Promotional Materials** 

   - To help us promote your event, we ask that you provide the following along with your proposal: 
   
     - A detailed outline or script of your workshop content 
     - A thumbnail designed for YouTube (1280x720px) 
     - A thumbnail designed for Luma (1080x1080px) 
     - An event description that we can use on our promotional platforms 
     - Links to your workshop and livestream event
