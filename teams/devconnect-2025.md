Our Technical Director, Robmar ([@robmarn](https://x.com/robmarn)), is an audiovisual editor/photographer (TV/radio/print) and the creator of [ZKRadio](https://zcashesp.com/zk-radio/), built to champion voices in privacy and decentralization; he’s an expert in bringing remote, multi-platform broadcast capability and live, real-time translation to make every conversation accessible. 

Aura ([@SoyAuraBrito](https://x.com/SoyAuraBrito)) and Roosevelt ([@gordonesTV](https://x.com/gordonesTV)) are a community-building and content-creation team with 28+ years of combined experience. They help decentralized communities grow through human connection, hands-on learning, and open technology. Aura builds strong communities, leads content efforts, and designs training programs.
