### Zk Av Club Recording Station 

An on-site, volunteer-run media lab where attendees can document conversations, ideas, and stories in high-quality AV—building a shared, open archive for the community.

### Foundry: Salon and Workshops 

Participatory livestreams for privacy-first communities. Zk Av Club Foundry combines an open Salon with community-led Workshops to explore free and open-source software (FOSS) and decentralized tech in practice. Come to learn, contribute, and help design how we document and distribute community knowledge—without compromising privacy.

Salon: A monthly chat with people building in the open — FOSS, P2P, decentralized governance, brand/design, transcription, more. We go live the final Friday at 15:00 UTC. [Check our calendar](https://lu.ma/zkav).

Workshops: Practical, community-led livestreams on real-world workflows — event coverage, content creation with FOSS, and streaming on decentralized networks. [Lead a workshop](/workshops).

### Testimonials   

Zk Av Club is a throwback to the grassroots ethos of the early days of the crypto revolution. Uncompromising in their community-first approach to audio/visual education and support, Zk Av Club gives a voice to the individuals behind the camera, in the booth, working before, during and after the event to share the news and progress the world needs to know. The Zcash Foundation was an early champion for the Club and we remain invested in their present and their bright future. The world needs more impactful and community-led projects like Zk Av Club!

I've always been fascinated with how folks find things because it illustrates a unique mapping. On its face, this might seem insignificant, but if you study these mappings on a deeper level, you realize something special; a shielded truth. On my journey discovering Zcash, I randomly discovered AdjyLeak, and in conjunction, Zk Av Club. Through the club, I experienced not only my first time connecting with *many* like minded folks through live streaming, but also a vast archive of knowledge I didn't even know existed! If you like adventure, computer science, and community, I couldn't recommend a better environment to start your journey.

Ryan and Zk Av Club are great, not just a streaming and media team but also deep community leadership and advocacy. They have been a reliable fixture of the Zcash community as well as adjacent ones like DWeb, and has helped make connections with other local communities around the globe, such as Zcash Brazil. They've run self contained livestream and recording for Zcash conferences, as well as hosting chill hybrid and remote hangouts. My favorite is seeing Ryan bring AV training sessions to newly formed local groups with minimal equipment, empowering them to improve their own global media abilities and stay included.

have you ever been to cozy virtual meeting space full of people who don't expect you to know it all? this is what Zk Av Club is. join with zero knowledge about video or any kind of media/arts and start learning bit by bit - its a vibe. you might learn there are so many awesome useful open source free tools you never even knew to look for. 
 
the club is also big on experimenting. each member can use their new knowledge to start creating something they want or join forces with others to collaborate. best part is when you find a chance to be part of some on-location events or workshops with other club members. 
 
join it and find out if its something for you.

Zk Av Club is a source of inspiration for me and for everyone who comes. Seeing the work they do behind the scenes and then the staging in each event or streaming, is definitely a motivation to learn more about everything audiovisual. As a member of the team I can say that every day is an opportunity to learn, grow and contribute from my knowledge as well. Long live the club!

The Audiovisual Club has been a space for me to connect with technology, open source and content generation geeks like me.
 
I like being part of the team because there is freedom of creativity, opinion and action. Although we all work for the same purpose (teaching and spreading privacy and free technologies), we can all have our style with freedom. 
 
I hope more people join the Club and enjoy the experience!

I worked with zkAV club in Berlin to produce my talk for ZConV. They ran the entire virtual event with a lean team, and made it very engaging and interactive. I appreciate their deep knowledge of the privacy space and their contributions to events in the community, and hope to work with them on many projects to come.

Ryan is a pro. His production work is top shelf as evidenced by his work on Zcons through the years, and his commitment to providing engaging and informative content. With Zk Av Club he continues his dedication and professionalism while also widening the tent to welcome and include new voices from all around the world and across industries. His professionalism, empathy and deep interest in the topics and people he’s engaged with shines above all.

The diversity of backgrounds and languages is celebrated, fostering a rich communal spirit. 

Beyond being an incubator for creativity, ZK AV has evolved into a highly effective organization. They leverage their expertise in audiovisual production, zero-knowledge technologies, and blockchain to elevate events to new heights.
