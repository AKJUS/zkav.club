Zk Av Club originated from early community livestreaming efforts by Ryan ([Adjy Leak](https://www.youtube.com/adjyleak)) as shared media infrastructure for everyone who wants to create content documenting their own ecosystem, whether it’s devs, community organizers, tech & non tech researchers. Adjy Leak streamed early Ethereum meetups and related events then expanded the team and infrastructure to the community-run recording station at which point the decentralized AV club materialized. 

Our Recording Station Tech Lead, Robmar ([@robmarn](https://x.com/robmarn)), creator of [ZKRadio](https://zcashesp.com/zk-radio/), a Spanish-language radio-style programme and community initiative focusing on privacy and decentralization. He's specialized in remote, multi-platform broadcast and real-time translation to make every conversation accessible to LatAm and global communities. 

Aura ([@SoyAuraBrito](https://x.com/SoyAuraBrito)) and Roosevelt ([@gordonesTV](https://x.com/gordonesTV)) are a community-building and content-creation team with 28+ years of combined experience. They help decentralized communities grow through human connection, hands-on learning, and open technology. Aura builds strong communities, leads content efforts, and designs training programs. Roosevelt is a blogger, podcaster, facilitator, and fintech advisor who promotes Open Source and Free Software. Together they plan, teach, and make useful content—workshops, guides, and advisory sessions that help people learn and work better. 

Vito ([@vitozkp](https://x.com/vitozkp)) is a video and audio editor who’s handled camera coordination for Zcon Voices and supported production at Zcon Barcelona and ECC Summit in Prague. He focuses on post-production, recording and editing tutorials, interviews, and shorts—and steps in for community management and AV support as needed. 

Ksenya ([@j32804](https://x.com/j32804)) has been working in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2014, helping people to self-organize around systems & protocols without centralized control. She ran DAO Space at CCCamp 2015 ([OpenCodeTown](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Village:OpenCodeTown)), co-hosted the [Oktahedron](https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/oktahedron/id1150041676?l=en-GB) podcast, is a member of Social Distortion, and helped build quadratic voting for ETHBerlin 2023 with FactoryDAO. At Zk Av Club she’s rebooting Oktahedron and testing content provenance on Swarm. For Devconnect she’s setting up a compact audio/stream rig with a Bee client on ARM to sign content, then taking the workflow to Chaos Congress.
