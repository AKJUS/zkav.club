### Zk Av Club Foundry 

Zk Av Club Foundry is our recurring livestream series — combining topical discussions with practical community-led workshops — diving deep into specific aspects of emerging technologies. Foundry isn’t just about watching or listening; it’s about participating, learning, and shaping the future of community information sharing. 

Salon: Informative discussions with people who work in the field, covering everything from peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing to decentralized community governance, from brand and design to transcription and the latest free open-source software (FOSS) developments. Always with privacy in focus. 

Workshops: Practical workshops where you can get your hands dirty and learn about real-world applications, from event coverage and content creation using FOSS to livestreaming on decentralized networks. 

Curriculum design and production by Ryan Taylor, Aura Brito, Robmar Enoe, and Roosevelt Gordones, with additional support from autotunafish, decentralistdan, and zkSquirrel. 

Zk Av Club Foundry is made possible with [contributions from our fans](#support-zk-av-club) and funds from [Zcash Community Grants](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/). 


### Zk Av Club's Voices  

Zk Av Club is a throwback to the grassroots ethos of the early days of the crypto revolution. Uncompromising in their community-first approach to audio/visual education and support, Zk Av Club gives a voice to the individuals behind the camera, in the booth, working before, during and after the event to share the news and progress the world needs to know. The Zcash Foundation was an early champion for the Club and we remain invested in their present and their bright future. The world needs more impactful and community-led projects like the Zk Av Club!

For years, Ryan Taylor and the Zk Av Club have provided exceptional live streaming for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events, ensuring global reach and high-quality broadcasts. Their dedication is unmatched.

I've always been fascinated with how folks find things because it illustrates a unique mapping. On its face, this might seem insignificant, but if you study these mappings on a deeper level, you realize something special; a shielded truth. On my journey discovering Zcash, I randomly discovered AdjyLeak, and in conjunction, the zkav.club. Through the club, I experienced not only my first time connecting with *many* like minded folks through live streaming, but also a vast archive of knowledge I didn't even know existed! If you like adventure, computer science, and community, I couldn't recommend a better environment to start your journey.

Ryan and Zk Av Club are great, not just a streaming and media team but also deep community leadership and advocacy. They have been a reliable fixture of the Zcash community as well as adjacent ones like dweb, and has helped make connections with other local communities around the globe, such as Zcash Brazil. They've run self contained livestream and recording for Zcash conferences, as well as hosting chill hybrid and remote hangouts. My favorite is seeing Ryan bring AV training sessions to newly formed local groups with minimal equipment, empowering them to improve their own global media abilities and stay included.

Over the past two years, the Zk Av Club has emerged as a vibrant, transformative force in the Zcash community. It has grown organically from a grassroots initiative into a global collective of content creators and media producers who combine creativity with innovative media production technologies and techniques. 
 
The Club’s commitment to privacy-first principles and their use of decentralized tools perfectly aligns with Zcash's core values. Their work in producing educational content, and fostering community engagement has benefited and strengthened the entire Zcash ecosystem.
 
The Zk Av Club serves as a great example of the power of grassroots, community-driven initiatives in advancing the Zcash mission.

have you ever been to cozy virtual meeting space full of people who don't expect you to know it all? this is what Zk Av Club is. join with zero knowledge about video or any kind of media/arts and start learning bit by bit - its a vibe. you might learn there are so many awesome useful open source free tools you never even knew to look for. 
 
the club is also big on experimenting. each member can use their new knowledge to start creating something they want or join forces with others to collaborate. best part is when you find a chance to be part of some on-location events or workshops with other club members. 
 
join it and find out if its something for you.

The ZK Audiovisual Club is a source of inspiration for me and for everyone who comes. Seeing the work they do behind the scenes and then the staging in each event or streaming, is definitely a motivation to learn more about everything audiovisual. As a member of the team I can say that every day is an opportunity to learn, grow and contribute from my knowledge as well. Long live the club!

The Audiovisual Club has been a space for me to connect with technology, open source and content generation geeks like me.
 
I like being part of the team because there is freedom of creativity, opinion and action. Although we all work for the same purpose (teaching and spreading privacy and free technologies), we can all have our style with freedom. 
 
I hope more people join the Club and enjoy the experience!

I worked with zkAV club in Berlin to produce my talk for ZConV. They ran the entire virtual event with a lean team, and made it very engaging and interactive. I appreciate their deep knowledge of the privacy space and their contributions to events in the community, and hope to work with them on many projects to come.

Ryan is a pro. His production work is top shelf as evidenced by his work on Zcons through the years, and his commitment to providing engaging and informative content. With the zkAV club he continues his dedication and professionalism while also widening the tent to welcome and include new voices from all around the world and across industries. His professionalism, empathy and deep interest in the topics and people he’s engaged with shines above all.

The ZK AV Club is a remarkable grassroots initiative born from the passion of Zcash community members worldwide. It has created an inclusive environment where individuals can learn from one another and explore audiovisual tools aimed at enhancing Zcash awareness. I am continually impressed by the members' unwavering support for each other, regardless of their experience level—whether newcomers or seasoned AV experts. The diversity of backgrounds and languages is celebrated, fostering a rich communal spirit. 

Beyond being an incubator for creativity, ZK AV has evolved into a highly effective organization. They leverage their expertise in audiovisual production, zero-knowledge technologies, and blockchain to elevate events to new heights. Their commitment to collaboration and innovation truly sets them apart in the community!
